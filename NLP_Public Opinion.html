				<h3 style="text-align:left;">Problems</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;">Offline studying policy in Indonesia had been ordered to school in the early
					month of
					January in the year 2022, which caused several debate about such policy. According to previous
					statement, our client which run in tuition services requested the aid of out services to provide
					sentiment analysis. Thus it is essential to understand the perspective of society about it to
					formulize some kind of promotion strategy.</p>

				<p style="text-align:left;"> <b>PTM</b>: An offline learning policy used as a keyword to web scrape from
					Twitter and news website (Kompas.com)

				<h3 style="text-align:left;">Analysis</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;">Analysis of the sentiment was targeted 3 days prior (from 23 January 2022
					until 26 January 2022), resulting in 345 row of data, consisting of 300 tweets and 45 news title.

				<a class="image main"><img src="images/eda_nlp_overall.png" alt="" /></a>
				<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 75%">Overall distribution of data</p>

				<p style="text-align:left;">Based on data distribution, overall tweet and news title length are short,
					with no longer than 50 characters and no more than 16 sentences, indicating the tendency of
					short and simple way of sharing information.</p>

				<a class="image main"><img src="images/overall_common.png" alt="" /></a>
				<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 75%">Overall common word distribution and combination</p>

				<p style="text-align:left;"> PTM has the highest count based on the methodology of using that word as a
					keyword, resulting in the highest number. To further understand the sentiment of each of the tweets
					and news title, machine learning was used to conduct story building and context understanding.
					Based on the machine learning, we discovered there were 4 context, that is overall reffering to the
					increasing numbers of offline learning fro school and also encouragement for students, teachers, and
					parents.

				<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 75%">Sentiment analysis</p>
				<hr color="black">

				<p style="text-align:left;">Based on the overall context, there is support regarding the offline
					learning policy.
					For the sentiment analysis itself, data shown an average sentiment of 0 toward this
					topic. This result means that within the range of sampling days (3 days), people tend to be neutral.
					Neutrality maybe due to several factors, such as a majority of people is not affected by situation (for example, not having children).</p>

				<p style="text-align:left;">For the purpose of the project, we must consider the positive and negative perspective as well. 
					Based on the graph above, it is shown that positive response has a higher value comparing to the negative one. 
					The result provide a promising view of expanding the offline tuition promotion toward the latter months.</p>
