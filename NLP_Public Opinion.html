					<h1><a class="button large">Aiding Tuition Promotion Strategy</a></h1>
					<p>Due to the fact that online studying hindered student's learning ability, thus tuition is
						certainly more favorable, especially if it is done directly(offline). </p>

				<h3 style="text-align:left;">Problems</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;">Offline studying policy had been ordered to school in the early month of
					January in the year 2022, which caused several debate about such policy. According to previous
					statement, our client which run in tuition services requested the aid of out services to provide
					sentiment analysis. Thus it is essential to understand the perspective of society about it to
					formulize some kind of promotion strategy.</p>

				<h3 style="text-align:left;">Features</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;"> <b>PTM</b>: An offline learning policy used as a keyword to web scrape from
					Twitter and news website (Kompas.com)

				<hr color="black">
				<h3 style="text-align:left;">Analysis</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;">Analysis of the sentiment was targeted 3 days prior (from 23 January 2022
					untik 26 January 2022), resulting in 345 row of datas, consisting of 300 tweets and 45 news title.

				<a class="image main"><img src="images/eda_nlp_overall.png" alt="" /></a>
				<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 75%">Overall distribution of data</p>

				<p style="text-align:left;">Based on data distribution, overall tweet and news title length are short,
					with no longer than 50 characters and no more than 16 sentences, indicating the tendency of
					short and simple way of sharing information.</p>

				<a class="image main"><img src="images/overall_common.png" alt="" /></a>
				<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 75%">Overall common word distribution and combination</p>

				<p style="text-align:left;"> PTM has the highest count based on the methodology of using that word as a
					keyword, resulting in the highest number. To further understand the sentiment of each of the tweets
					and news title, machine learning was used to conduct story building and context understanding.
					Based on the machine learning, we discovered there were 4 context, that is overall reffering to the
					increasing numbers of offline learning fro school and also encouragement for students, teachers, and
					parents.

				<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 75%">Inflasion vs Earning</p>
				<hr color="black">

				<p style="text-align:left;">According to the hierarchy above, it is clear that earning(Pendapatan)
					effect and effected by inflation (Inflasi), thus, both of those variables are chosen for making
					clustering model. In this opportunity, K-Means Clustering is used due to the fact that the labeling
					of one countries' category is not yet clear, making unsupervised model more appealing.</p>

				<hr color="black">
				<a class="image main"><img src="images/KMean.png" alt="" /></a>
				<hr color="black">

				<p style="text-align:left;">Overall, there are two major groups of clustering, which is the higher
					income and lower income. For the lower income itself, it is divided again into two sub-clusters. To
					further understand why such sub-clusters are created, we can learn from the mean of each variables.

				<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 75%">Mean from Mid Income Group</p>

				<a class="image main"><img src="images/Tinggi.png" alt="" /></a>
				<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 75%">Mean from High Income Group</p>
				<hr color="black">

				<p style="text-align:left;">I would like to point out the fact there are three key variables that
					contribute to the creation of sub-clusters according to the analysis above. Firstly, there are a
					slight differences between two groups in fertility rate, where it is a bit higher in lower group.
					Secondly, life expectancy from lower group is much lower compare to the mid group (in fact, the mid
					group life expectancy is more resemble that of a higher group). And finally, expenses in healthcare.
					Although lower group has more percentage (though not that much differences) from the mid group.
					<br>From here on, we could see what problem that lower group country is facing, that is the lower
					life expectancy that is not in balance with the fertility rate. This is caused by the lack of
					funding in the healthcare sector, and so I would like to propose the idea of aiding in such sector
					for the countries with lower income that is less than 1000 because, based on previous analysis, we
					conclude that the lowest income has the potential in a decrease in human resources, therefore, the
					countries that I would to suggest is:
